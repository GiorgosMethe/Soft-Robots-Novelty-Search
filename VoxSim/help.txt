Command format:

./VoxSim -p -f <fitnessType(int)> -i <iputFile.vxa> -o <iputFile.vfo?>

fitnessTypes:
----------------------
FT_NONE,		0
FT_COM_DIST,		1
FT_COM_DIST_XY,		2
FT_COM_TOTAL_TRAJ_LENGTH,	3 	( Total trajectory distance travelled by SoftBot in body lengths)


Penalty types
----------------------
PT_NONE, 		0
PT_VOX_NUM, 		1 (=number of voxels in the structure)
PT_ACT_VOX_NUM, 	2 (=number of actuated voxels in the structure)
PT_CONN_NUM, 		3 (=number of connections in the structure)


BehaviorTypes
----------------------
BT_NONE,		0 (=records nothing)
BT_TRAJECTORY,		1 (=records the 3-D point trajectory) 
BT_TRAJECTORY_XY,	2 (=records 2-D point trajectory at axis parallel to the ground)
BT_PACE,		3 (=records pace at a specific moment)
BT_SHAPE,		4 (=returns a bitstream with the shape)
BT_VOXELS_GROUND	5 (=returns num of voxels touching the ground every timestep)
BT_KINETIC_ENERGY,	6 (=returns maximum kinetic energy of voxels per timestep)
BT_PRESSURE,	7 (=returns maximum pressure in the structure per timestep)


Options:
----------------------
-p:	prints stats during simulation

-o:	writes fitness in a file after the simulation is over in the specific path, do not give path "." if you want to write output in the same dir as the input simulation file.

-f:	fitness type

-fp:	fitness penalty function

-fpe:	fitness penalty exponential value

-b:	behavior type to record

-bi:	seconds between each recording

-bs:	seconds from simulation start recording starts

-i:	input simulation file "*.vxa"


Example:
----------------------

./VoxSim -i input.vxa -f 1 -fp 3 -fpe 1.5 -b 1 -bi 0.1 -o .

./VoxSim -i input.vxa -f 1 -fp 3 -fpe 1.5 -b 1 -bi 0.1 -o data/


Notes:
----------------------
The following variables have default values:
-f: 	fitness types				= FT_COM_DIST
-fp: 	fitness penalty function		= PT_NONE
-fpe: 	fitness penalty exponential values	= 1.5
-b: 	behavior type to record			= BT_NONE
-bi: 	seconds between each recording		= 0.01
